# NBA-Shot-Analysis

## Project Abstract
    The goal of this repo is to build a classification machine learning model to predict whether an NBA shot will go in or not, given the shot distance, the FG% of the zone the shot is in, the Defensive Win Shares per 48mins, Defender Distance, Touch Time, and Shot Clock remaining.
    In addition, this repo is creating a recommender system for player shooting frequency in the zones of a court. For instance, the recommender system compares your points per shot (PPS) in each zone with the league average. At the basic level, it recommends all zones where your PPS is greater than the league average, and discourages you from continuing to shoot in areas where your PPS is lower than the league average.
    The next steps and future work of this project include optimizing the neural network and recommendation system. Also, the creator wants to use Dash and Flask to make the project accessible online. In this way, there is plenty of work to be done by students with all interests.
